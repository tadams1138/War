    We take privacy seriously. The only information we gathsader is to uniquely identify the voter and associate them with their vote. We use this information to perform analysis and prevent fraud (e.g. ballot stuffing). Your vote is not private. This is not a secret ballot. No other information is gathered from your account than is necessary to uniquely identify you, the voter.
